            <p>
                I am a 19 year-old goal-oriented, dedicated and ambitious final year student, concurrently pursuing two qualifications: Information Technology specializing in Software Engineering at Nelson Mandela University and Computer Science with a focus on Data Science at the University of the People. I am passionate about the ever-evolving discipline of Technology, most notably the Interplay of Quantum Computing and Financial Engineering, with a focus on investigating the potential impact and applications of quantum computing in financial modeling and risk management. Rooted in a technical foundation, I am enthusiastic to work in a setting where I can effectively bridge the gap between innovation and real-world application while also solving global financial challenges.

My academic journey so far has equipped me with a solid understanding of programming languages, data structures, algorithmic design, data science and computational intelligence. I am particularly intrigued by the intersection of financial engineering, quantum computing, and exploring the application of quantum computing by utilising quantum neural networks and quantum-inspired algorithms for processing and analyzing complex financial data (such as risk modeling, algorithmic trading, and/or portfolio optimization within the financial environment).

Aspiring to contribute as a tech innovator in the realm of Quantum Computing and Financial Engineering, I am open to collaborations, internships, and projects that provide avenues for further skill development and meaningful contributions to advancements at the intersection of technology and finance. Let's connect and explore possibilities to make positive impacts in the ever-evolving landscape of Financial Technology.
